        "LangServe helps developers deploy LangChain runnables and chains as a REST API. Through the built-in Runnable object, you can easily create data pipelines from various components. These pipelines are ultimately provided through APIs called invoke, batch, and stream.\n",
        "This library is integrated with FastAPI and uses pydantic for data validation.\n",

        "LangGraph Platform is a commercial solution for deploying agentic applications to production, built on the open-source LangGraph framework.\n",
        "- **LangGraph Server** : The server defines an opinionated API and architecture that incorporates best practices for deploying agentic applications, allowing you to focus on building your agent logic rather than developing server infrastructure.\n",
        "- **LangGraph Studio** : LangGraph Studio is a specialized IDE that can connect to a LangGraph Server to enable visualization, interaction, and debugging of the application locally.\n",
        "- **LangGraph CLI** : LangGraph CLI is a command-line interface that helps to interact with a local LangGraph\n",

        "- Checkpoint Functionality: Save and recover task states\n",
        "- Memory Management: Maintain data like conversation history across sessions\n",
