    "Regardless of the model's architecture, performance significantly degrades when including more than 10 retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, when the model needs to access relevant information in the middle of a long context, it tends to ignore the provided documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, please refer to the following paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this issue, you can prevent performance degradation by reordering documents after retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a retriever that can store and search text data using the Chroma vector store.\n",
    "Use the retriever's invoke method to search for highly relevant documents for a given query.\n",
