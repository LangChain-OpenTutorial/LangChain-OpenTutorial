    "\n",
    "This tutorial compares two approaches to translating Chinese text into English using LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach utilizes a single LLM (e.g. GPT-4) to generate a straightforward translation. The second approach employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances translation accuracy by retrieving relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial evaluates the translation accuracy and performance of each method, helping users choose the most suitable approach for their needs.\n",
