    "\n",
    "This tutorial compares two approaches to translating Chinese text into English using LangChain.\n",

    "The first approach utilizes a single LLM (e.g. GPT-4) to generate a straightforward translation. The second approach employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances translation accuracy by retrieving relevant documents.\n",

    "The tutorial evaluates the translation accuracy and performance of each method, helping users choose the most suitable approach for their needs.\n",

    "\n",
    "Evaluating machine translation quality is essential to ensure the accuracy and fluency of translated text. In this tutorial, we use two key metrics, TER and BERTScore, to assess the quality of translations produced by both a general LLM-based translation system and a RAG-based translation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining TER and BERTScore, we achieve a comprehensive evaluation of translation quality.\n",
    "TER measures the structural differences and required edits between translations and reference texts.\n",
    "BERTScore captures the semantic similarity between translations and references.\n",
    "This dual evaluation approach allows us to effectively compare LLM and RAG translations, helping determine which method provides more accurate, fluent, and natural translations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**TER (Translation Edit Rate)**\n",
    "\n",
    "TER quantifies how much editing is required to transform a system-generated translation into the reference translation. It accounts for insertions, deletions, substitutions, and Shifts (word reordering).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "Lower TER indicates a better translation (fewer modifications needed).\n",
    "Higher TER suggests that the translation deviates significantly from the reference\n",
    "\n",
    "**BERTScore - Contextual Semantic Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "BERTScore evaluates translation quality by computing semantic similarity scores between reference and candidate translations. It utilizes contextual embeddings from a pre-trained BERT model, unlike traditional n-gram-based methods that focus solely on word overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "Higher BERTScore (closer to 1.0) indicates better semantic similarity between the candidate and reference translations.\n",
    "Lower scores indicate less semantic alignment with the reference translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging both TER and BERTScore, we can effectively analyze the strengths and weaknesses of LLM-based and RAG-based translation methods."
