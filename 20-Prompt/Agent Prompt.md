# Prompt for Agent

## Description
- Unlike conventional prompts that focus on generating a single response, Agentic prompts include the use of tools and decision-making steps.
- Agentic prompts can be described as a prompt structure designed to achieve purposes such as **intelligent task processing** (which autonomously breaks down complex goals into sub-steps and selects and utilizes the necessary tools for each step), **adaptive learning systems** (which evaluate intermediate results and reflect and remember them), and **collaboration** (which coordinates and mediates multiple agents).

**Intelligent Task Processing**
- Autonomously breaking down complex goals into sub-steps
- Selecting and utilizing optimized tools for each step
- Establishing and adjusting execution plans for each stage

**Adaptive Learning Systems**
- Continuous evaluation of intermediate results
- Memory storage of performance history and feedback
- Performance optimization through accumulated experience

**Collaboration**
- Coordination of tasks among multiple agents
- Efficient utilization of specialized agents
- Mediation for the derivation of integrated results

These characteristics combine organically to enable the performance of more complex and intelligent tasks, which is the essence of Agentic prompts.

Detailed prompts regarding evaluation, collaboration, and reasoning are covered in other documents; therefore, this document focuses on the definition and authority of agents, state and memory management, and tool integration and result processing.
